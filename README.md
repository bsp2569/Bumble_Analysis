Bumble User Behavior Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a real-world Bumble user dataset to uncover demographic patterns, lifestyle attributes, and behavioral trends that influence engagement on the platform. The analysis covers complete data cleaning, transformation, feature understanding, and insight generation with a business-oriented perspective.

 Project Overview

Dating platforms thrive on understanding user behavior. This analysis aims to answer questions such as:
	•	Who are the dominant user demographics?
	•	How do lifestyle attributes (diet, drinking habits, fitness levels) vary across users?
	•	Which cities/states have the highest concentration of users?
	•	How do factors like income, height, or activity levels shape user engagement?

The notebook performs full-scale EDA to derive these insights.
